        <h1 class="post-full__title">My new journey as a frontend student.</h1>
        <p class="post-full__lead">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the
          big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded
          peers.</p>

        <h2 class="post-full__heading">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="post-full__text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
          learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
          projects.</p>
        <p class="post-full__text">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
          most things about my
          journey
          with the world.</p>
        <h2 class="post-full__heading">How I got started</h2>
        <p class="post-full__text">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes
          about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
          but also write short summaries
          of what I learned using my own words.</p>
        <p class="post-full__text">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
          summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
